For ixdat 0.3.0
===============

API Changes
-----------
This release marks an important change in ixdat's organization resulting from the
disscusions under the `calculators label. <https://github.com/ixdat/ixdat/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Acalculators>`_
and `PR #182 <https://github.com/ixdat/ixdat/pull/182>`_.

- Nearly all calculations for processing and analyzing raw data are moved into a
  new type of Saveable class, ``Calculators``. These take over from the
  ``Calibration`` classes of ixdat 0.1.x and 0.2.x but the name is more general in
  order to accomodate e.g. ``Filters`` and ``Backgrounds`` which have been long
  anticipated (see `Issue #147 <https://github.com/ixdat/ixdat/issues/147>`_), as well as what were formerly known as
  ``series_constructor``s

- To use language that we've employed for quantitative mass spectrometry,
  ``Calibration`` classes are in general for both *calibration*, whereby values
  needed to perform a certain type of data analysis, like sensitivity factors,
  are extracted from one measurement (representing a calibration experiment);
  and *quantification* where these values are applied to analyze data from another
  measurement (representing the experiment of interest).
  - Calibration is generally done by constructor class methods, e.g.::

    calc = MSCalibration.gas_flux_calibration(measurement_1, ...)

  where ``MSCalibration`` is a class that inherits from ``Calculator``.

  - Quantification is generally done by normal object methods, e.g.::

      n_dot_H2 = calc.calc_flux(measurement_2, mol="H2", ...)

    All ``Calculator`` classes have a special quantification method called
    ``calculate_series(measurement, series_name)`` which, if possible,
    returns a ``ValueSeries`` for ``series_name`` derived from data in
    ``measurement`` and the ``Calculator``'s own internal data.

  Ideas behind this are described in `Issue #164 <https://github.com/ixdat/ixdat/issues/164>`_.

- All of the ``series_name``s that can be used in a ``Calculator``'s
  ``calculate_series`` method are included in the set
  ``Calculator.available_series_names``. In general, this is a dynamic property, as
  it may depend on which internal data the calculator object has. For example,
  an ``MSCalculator`` object which has a sensitivity factor for "H2" at "M2" will
  include ``"n_dot_H2"`` in its ``available_series_names`` whereas one which
  instead only has a sensitivity factor for "O2" at "M32" will not.

- A ``Calculator`` object (``calc``) can be attached to a ``Measurement`` object
  (``meas``) by calling ``meas.add_calculator(calc)``. This makes it possible to
  directly ``grab`` or look up any of the series in that calculator's
  ``available_series_names``. A few challenges arise here with regards to calculator
  chaining, (an example is when we want to grab a molecular flux that is both quantified from
  the raw mass signals and also background subtracted, or not). Thise issues
  are described in `issue #183 <https://github.com/ixdat/ixdat/issues/183>`_.
  The solution implemented is described in the first comment to that issue, and
  demonstrated in **demo_calculators.py**.

- A ``Measurement`` class can have a ``default_calculator`` class. An object of this
  class is initiated (using ``__init__``, not a constructor method) and automatically
  attached to the measurement object (``meas``) by calling the method
  ``meas.calibrate(...)``. A ``Measurement`` class also has a list of
  ``built_in_calculator_types`` for which a calculator is initiated with default
  arguments and appended to ``meas`` upon its initation, and can have a list of
  ``background_calculator_types`` which are ignored when the argument
  ``remove_background=False`` is passed to ``grab`` and methods that use ``grab``.

Calculators
^^^^^^^^^^^

The code for ``Calculator`` classes is in the modules in **src/ixdat/calculators/**.
As of now, the following are included:

- ``indexer.Indexer`` is in the built-in
  calculators of the ``Measurement`` base class. Every ``Measurement`` object thus
  has an indexer. It is used for easily choosing a subset of the measurement.
  - available_series_names: "file_number" and "selector". ``calculate_series``
    uses the following methods, respectively, for those two series names:
  - ``_build_file_number_series``, formerly the series constructor
    ``Measurement._build_file_number_series``
  - ``_build_selector``, formerly the series constructor
    ``Measurement._build_selector_series``

- ``ec_calculators.ECCalibration`` is the default_calculator of ``ECMeasurement``.
  Otherwise, it is basically just moved from **techniques/ec.py**.
  - available_series_names: "potential" and "current"
  - "potential" is the raw_potential (i) adjusted to the RHE scale if ``RE_vs_RHE``
    is included and (ii) corrected for ohmic drop if ``R_Ohm`` is included
  - "current" is the raw_current (i) normalized to electrode area if ``A_el``
    is included.
  - Note that looking up "potential" or "current" in an ``ECMeasurement`` without
    an ``ECCalibration`` returns "raw_potential" or "raw_current", respectively, as
    in ixdat v0.2.x

- ``ec_calculators.ScanRateCalculator`` is a built-in calculator for ``CyclicVoltammogram``,
  previously implemented as a function and methods of ``CyclicVoltammogram``
  - available_series_names: "scan_rate"

- ``ms_calculators.MSCalibration`` is, like in ixdat 0.2.x, a wrapper around a list
  of sensitivity factors (themselves saveable as ``ms_calculators.MSCalResult``s).
  - available_series_names: "n_dot_{mol}" for all the mol in its ``mol_list``
  Constructor methods:
  - ``gas_flux_calibration``, formerly a method of ``MSMeasurement``.
  - ``gas_flux_calibration_curve``, formerly a method of ``MSMeasurement``.

- ``ms_calculators.MSBackgroundSet`` is a new calculator that replaces the poor
  incomplete implementation of backgrounds previously in ``MSCalibration``. The
  structure is similar to ``MSCalibration`` in that a ``MSBackgroundSet`` contains
  a set of saveable ``MSBackground`` objects, each for a single m/z. So far, only
  one type of background is implemented, the ``MSConstantBackground``.
  - available_series_names: mass_list.
  - Note that The available series names have the same names as the corresponding
    raw data series before background subtraction. To get the raw series, grab or
    look up ``f"{mass}-raw"`` or ``grab`` with ``remove_background=False``.

- ``ecms_calculators.ECMSCalibration`` is not a real calculator in the sense that
  it doesn't do *quantification*. Instead, it does *calibration*, and its calibration
  methods, listed below, all return ``MSCalibration`` objects. This is consistent
  with the fact that an EC-MS calibration experiment can be used to obtain sensitivity
  factors for a setup which is then used without electrochemistry (e.g. for thermal
  catalysis measurements). The calibration methods are
  - ``ecms_calibration``, formerly a method of ``ECMSMeasurement``
  - ``ecms_calibration_curve``, also formerly a method of ``ECMSMeasurement``

- ``ecms_calculators.ECMSImpulseResponse``, moved from **deconvolution.py**, is the
  deconvolution calculator. An ``ECMSImpulseResponse`` object (``imp_resp``)
  describes the response of one ``mol``. It's demonstrated in
  **deconvolution_demo.py**.
  - available_series_names: "n_dot_{mol}-deconvoluted". Getting this from an
    ``MSMeasurement`` with ``imp_resp`` attached requires that there is also another
    calculator which provides "n_dot_{mol}".
  Constructor methods:
  - ``from_measurement`` takes the shape of the impulse response from a measurement
    representing an impulse experiment, i.e. one where a short burst of product (e.g.
    "H2" form hydrogen evolution) is produced at the electrode and its mass signal,
    after broadening by mass transport between the electrode and the inlet, recorded.
  - ``from_model`` calculates the shape of the impulse response according to a mass
    transport model.

- ``xrf_calculators.TRXRFCalculator`` is a built-in calculator of ``TRXRFMeasurement``
  which replaces a simple series_constructor.
  - available_series_names: "FF_over_I0"


One ``Calculator``, the ``siqCalculator`` for advanced MS and EC-MS calibration,
is implemented as a plugin. At present, this is in **src/ixdat/plugins/siq_plugin.py**.

- ``siqCalculator`` implements all the calibration and quantification methods that
  make use of the external ``spectro_inlets_quantification`` package. The calibration
  methods were previously methods of ``MSMeasurement`` and ``ECMSMeasurement`` prefixed
  "siq_", and the quantification methods were accessed through an overloading of
  ``MSMeasurement.grab()``.

  Constructor methods:
  - ``gas_flux_calibration``, formerly ``MSMeasurement.siq_gas_flux_calibration``.
  - ``gas_flux_calibration_curve``, formerly ``MSMeasurement.siq_gas_flux_calibration_curve``.
  - ``multicomp_gas_flux_calibration``, formerly ``MSMeasurement.siq_multicomp_gas_flux_calibration``
  - ``ecms_calibration``, formerly ``ECMSMeasurement.siq_ecms_calibration``
  - ``ecms_calibration_curve``, formerly ``ECMSMeasurement.siq_ecms_calibration_curve``
  Useage:
  - A ``siqCalculator`` object (``siqcalc``) inherits from
    ``spectro_inlets_quantification.Calibration`` (as well as ``ixdat.Calculator``),
    which implements addition, visualization, and sensitivity factor prediction
  - Before use, a ``siqCalculator`` object must be given a ``mol_list`` and ``mass_list``,
    which are used to define a ``SensitivityMatrix``, as well as a ``carrier`` gas
    (typically "He") as needed by ``siq.Quantifier``. These parameters are given
    by the method ``siqcalc.set_quantifier(mol_list=..., mass_list=..., carrier=...)``.
  - available_series_names: "n_dot_{mol}" for all the mol in its ``mol_list``, but
    only once ``mol_ist`` has been given via the ``set_quantifier`` method

  Use of ``siqCalculator`` is demonstrated in **demo_siq_integration.py** and
  **demo_ecms_calibration_curve.py**.


For ixdat 0.2.13
===============

Debugging
---------
- Fixed timestamp form in ``QexafsDATReader`` to correctly parse timezone all year.


API changes
-----------

- Time-resolved x-ray flouresence (``technique = "TRXRF"``) implemented in `PR #168 <https://github.com/ixdat/ixdat/pull/168>`_:

  - ``B18TRXRFReader`` (reader="b18_trxrf") implemented for reading TRXRF data from the Diamond lightsource beamline B18TRXRFReader

  - ``TRXRFMeasurement`` with a series constructor method for the value series of interest, "FF_over_I0", and ``TRXRFPlotter`` for plotting the TRXRF data.
  
  - Hyphenation of TRXRF with EC (``technique = "EC-TRXRF"``) implemented (syntax: ``ec_txrf = ec + trxrf``) in ``ECTRXRFMeasurement`` and ``ECTRXRFPlotter``


- Deconvolution module based on Krempl et al. 2021 https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c00110 
  is revived. ``ECMSImpulseResponse`` is a class for calculating an impulse response
  as input for deconvolution. It can generated either from a measured impulse response using class method 
  ``.from_measurement()`` or from mass transport parameters using class method ``.from_parameters``.
  Several methods of ECMSMeasurement class use this new class: ``grab_deconvoluted_signal()`` allows to grab
  a an tuple of time and value arrays (similar to other ``grab()`` methods). ``deconvolute_for_tspans()`` loops
  through a number of tspans for which to deconvolute data with options to plot and export the original + decon-
  voluted data. For examples see deconvolution_demo.py in development_scripts
